# AI-Based-Fake-News-Detection-System
The AI-Based Fake News Detection System is a machine learning project that aims to classify news articles as either true or fake. The project uses a dataset of labeled news articles, where each article is marked as either true or fake. The goal is to train a machine learning model to predict the label (true or fake) of a new, unseen news article.
